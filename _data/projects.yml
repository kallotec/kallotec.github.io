        Old project from back in the early days, it occured to me the idea of using reflection to create an automated testing tool for developers that ran tests on managed DLLs without users writing a single line of code(!), the result was Puppeteer. Best suited for procedural libraries with simple input and output methods. Generates UI for constructor instantiation and method arguments, saves test projects as files, tracks coverage, and generates run reports.
