## Multiple interviews and their order

Interviews are obligation free with nothing to lose. Set up interviews at multiple places, not just the one place you want to get a job at. More interviews means more practice, and also some of the places might turn out to sound way better than you initially thought.

If, say, you apply at 5 different places, interview at the place you like the least first and work through them from worst to best order, so that by the time you get to the interview for the place you like the most, you're very well practiced

## Setting a meeting time

Don't have them just before lunch, or just before home time or after work. At those times, both the interviewers and you are either hungry, tired or just wanting to get home, which arn't optimal states of mind for interviews.

## Keep it simple

Don't cram your brain with interview techniques and strategies. It is counter-productive because the more you're trying to remember on the day, the more stress is created.

It makes more sense to depend on what you know best, which is being yourself, who you've had experience with your whole life, rather than depending on techniques/strategies you've had experience with for about a few days.

## What to rehearse

Reflect over your career trials and triumphs, practice telling your story to a spouse or friend.

Also rehearse common interview questions with a spouse or friend.

Google "common interview questions".

Here are a few non-industry specific examples:
- "why did you apply for this role?"
- "why do you think I should hire you?"
- "give me an example of a challenge you faced and how you overcame it?"
- "What are your weaknesses?".

Then search for some industry specific ones as well to find the ones specific to the role that you're applying for. For example "common sales interview questions", "common programming interview questions", and rehearse those too.

This helps prevent feeling off-guard and panic'y, and helps better organize your thoughts and feel more confident on the day.

If they ask any of these, remember that they aren't asking these tough questions to try and "catch you out", they most likely have no idea what to ask and simply Googled the same thing as above!

## Employer red flags

- They don't seem to want to be there
- They arn't interested in what you do outside of work
- They don't care about your career goals
- They're annoyed or don't care or are disinterested in your questions
- Feels like they're trying to catch you out, like you're not trustworthy
- They try to project superiority, elitism, or try to make them sound better than you

## What you should actually be worried about

Getting a job at place that you'll hate.

Imagine this: worrying so much about saying everything perfect that you miss a key piece of information from them that could indicate that the role isn't a good fit for you. Then being offered a job based on the personality you projected in the meeting which was different to who you actually are, and spending a year or more in a worse job than your last, and not being able to go back to your last job. This is unfortunately pretty common, and you can see how easily it can happen.

Interviews should be viewed as what they actually are: two people getting to know each other, asking questions about each other's work. Then both people going away to have a think, and then deciding whether they'd like to work together, and then seeing if the other agrees. That's all it is.

There are zero risks or stakes: if either one of you decides to not continue, then you can happily continue on with your lives. If you say something dumb, then it doesn't matter because you'll probably never see them again. If you decide, after meeting, that you don't like the sound of it, there's no obligation to continue.

It's not really that different from when you meet someone new at a party. You are talking to them to see if you'll get along and they're doing the same. You might become good friends or you might not, not everyone in the world matches every other. Humor helps: I like to think of it like you're dating this new company to see if you both want to commit to moving in with each other.

Keep re-reading this section until the anxiety goes away!

## Write a list of questions

Over the few days leading to the meeting while you're doing other things, keep imagining yourself working in the role you're applying for and all the different situations you might encounter and tasks you might do, and write down any questions or concerns that come up. Write as many as you can think up that you are genuinely interested to know. On the day order them so that the most important questions are at the top, so that if time is short then you can at least ask the most important questions that'll affect your decision first.

This also helps take your mind off worrying about the meeting over the days leading up to it.

## Take the list of questions to the meeting

This shows organization, and also means you'll never have the situation of getting home after it and thinking "oh sh*t I forgot to ask about X and Y".

Having that list there with you also helps re-enforce to you that the meeting isn't all about them, it's a two-way street.

## Questions

When to ask questions depends on how they want to structure the chat, most interviewers like to ask all their questions first, and they'll let you ask yours after that if you have any. Other times it can be like a normal back-and-forth type of conversation where it doesn't matter when you ask. Just roll with whatever style they seem to be going with.

## Offers

Try to get offers from more than one employer. Having a second offer to accept can really be a lifesaver if you resign from your current job and the first offer you accepted gets rescinded (this happened to me).
