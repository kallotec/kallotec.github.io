## Multiple interviews and their order

Interviews are obligation free with nothing to lose. Set up interviews at multiple places.

If you have 3 job interviews, save the interview with the employer you like the most for last. By the time you get through the other interviews, you'll be much better practiced and prepared for the one you want the most.

Try to get offers from more than one employer. Having a second offer to accept can really be a lifesaver if you resign from your current job and the first offer you accepted gets rescinded (this happened to me).

## Setting a meeting time

Don't have them just before lunch, or just before home time or after work. Interviewers and you are either hungry or wanting to get home which isn't optimal.

## The time before the meeting

Don't cram your brain with interview techniques and strategies. It is counter-productive because the more you're trying to remember on the day, the more stress is created.

It makes more sense to depend on what you know best, which is being yourself, who you've had experience with your whole life, rather than depending on techniques/strategies you've had experience with for about a few days.

## What to rehearse

Aside from reflecting over your career, it helps a lot to rehearse common interview questions with a spouse or friend, as well as in your head.

Google "common interview questions".

Here are a few non-industry specific examples:
- "why did you apply for this role?"
- "why do you think I should hire you?"
- "give me an example of a challenge you faced and how you overcame it?"
- "What are your weaknesses?".

Then search for some industry specific ones as well to find the ones specific to the role that you're applying for. For example "common sales interview questions", "common programming interview questions", and rehearse those too.

This goes a long way toward not feeling caught off-guard and panic'y, and helps better organize your thoughts and feel more confident on the day.

If they ask any of these, remember that they aren't asking these tough questions to try and "catch you out", they most likely have no idea what to ask and simply Googled the same thing as above!

## The two-way street

Probably the biggest help is changing your perspective of what an interview actually is.

Imagine this: worrying so much about what you're saying that you miss a key piece of information from them that could indicate that the role isn't a good fit for you. Then being offered a job based on the personality you projected in the meeting which was different to who you actually are, and spending a year or more in a worse job than your last, and not being able to go back to your last job. This is unfortunately pretty common, and you can see how easily it can happen.

Rather than the scary thing people make it up to be, interviews should be viewed as what they actually are: two people getting to know each other, asking questions about each other's work. Then both people going away to have a think, and then deciding whether they'd like to work together, and then seeing if the other agrees. That's all it is.

There are zero risks or stakes: if either one of you decides to not continue, then you can happily continue on with your lives. If you say something dumb, then it doesn't matter because you'll probably never see them again. If you decide, after meeting, that you don't like the sound of it, there's no obligation to continue.

It's not really that different from when you meet someone new at a party. You are talking to them to see if you'll get along and they're doing the same. You might become good friends or you might not, not everyone in the world matches every other. Humor helps: I like to think of it like you're dating this new company to see if you both want to commit to moving in with each other.

Keep re-reading this section until the anxiety goes away!

## Write a list of questions

Over the few days leading to the meeting while you're doing other things, keep imagining yourself working in the role you're applying for and all the different situations you might encounter and tasks you might do, and write down any questions or concerns that come up. Write as many as you can think up that you are genuinely interested to know. On the day order them so that the most important questions are at the top, so that if time is short then you can at least ask the most important questions that'll affect your decision first.

This also helps take your mind off worrying about the meeting over the days leading up to it.

## Take the list of questions to the meeting

This shows organization, and also means you'll never have the situation of getting home after it and thinking "oh sh*t I forgot to ask about X and Y".

Having that list there with you also helps re-enforce to you that the meeting isn't all about them, it's a two-way street.

## Questions

When to ask questions depends on how they want to structure the chat, most interviewers like to ask all their questions first, and they'll let you ask yours after that if you have any. Other times it can be like a normal back-and-forth type of conversation where it doesn't matter when you ask. Just roll with whatever style they seem to be going with.
